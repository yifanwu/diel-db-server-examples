# diel-db-server-examples

This repo is an example that demonstrates [diel](http://logical-interactions.github.io/diel) used in conjunction with [diel-db-server](https://github.com/yifanwu/diel-db-server).  If you want a simpler setup that does not require your setting anything up locally, checkout the web worker version [here](https://logical-interactions.github.io/diel-gallery/) --- the API and programming pattern are exactly the same.

## Instructions

You should go to `/simple-data`, read the readme and put the files in the folder `server/sample-data`, then do the following (with the last two commands in two separate windows).

```bash
npm install
npm run ui
npm run server
```
